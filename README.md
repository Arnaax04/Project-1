# Project-1
My First GitHub Repository

Hello! 👋  
This repository was created as part of the IBM SkillsBuild program activity to learn the basics of GitHub, including creating repositories and using README files.

Currently, this is just a demo repository with no actual project code. I am using it to:
- understand how GitHub works
- practice creating and managing repositories
- get comfortable with version control

More content may be added here in the future. 🚀
